#OutFocus RED

Hello, World.

OutFocus 3.0, codenamed OutFocus RED, is a WordPress theme in development for the major rebranding of OutFocus in 2016.

OutFocus RED, like WordPress, is open source. It's published under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html), which means it is free to reproduce and distribute as long as you include the original license (found along with this package).

OutFocus RED is being developed by CodeFeathers - http://www.thefeathers.in/code

OutFocus and CodeFeathers are subsidiaries of the Feathers - http://www.theFeathers.in

OutFocus is a free online magazine at http://www.OutFocus.in

##Version numbering


OutFocus RED uses the CodeFeathers numbering standard.
The format is as follows:

(major version).(minor version).(UI updates/patches).(date - yyyymmdd)

The date part of the version number is purely informational and can be ignored.

When the (minor version) number becomes 9, the update is in a major transition stage.

Hence, v2.8.x is an update to the v2.x.x line, while v2.9.x is a precursor to the v3.x.x line. This is to ensure that the first release candidate of a major version is always v.X.0.0
